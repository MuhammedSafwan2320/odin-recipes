    <p><h3> Ingrediants </h3></p>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> 1/2 lb. ground beef </li>
        <li> 1 lb. hot breakfast sausage </li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li> 2 cans (14.5 ounce) whole tomatoes
        </li>
        <li> 2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste
        </li>
        <li> 4 tbsp. dried parsley, divided
        </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp. dried basil
         </li>
         <li> 2 1/2 tsp. salt
        </li>
        <li> 3 c. lowfat cottage cheese
         </li>
         <li> 1 tbsp. olive oil
        </li>
    </ul></p>
<p> <h3> Preparation </h3></p>
     <ol> 
        <li> <strong>Cook the meat</strong>: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
    <li> Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
    <li> Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps. </li>
    <li> In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.  </li>
    <li> <strong>To assemble: </strong> Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
