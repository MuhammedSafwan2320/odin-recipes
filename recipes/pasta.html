    <p> <h2> Description </h2></p>
    <p> Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed inside an omelette.

        Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables haphazardly reheated in the microwave!</p>
<h2> Ingrediants </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 Eggs </li>
        <li> A pinch of pepper </li>
        <li> A pinch of salt </li>
        <li> One onion chooped </li>
        <li> 2 chiilies sliced </li>
    </ul>
    <ol> 
        <li> <strong> Beat the eggs: </strong> Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork </li>
        <li> <strong>Add the eggs:</strong> Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan. </li>
        <li> <strong> Fill the omelette: </strong> Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds </li>
        <li> <strong> Fold and serve.</li> </strong>
    </ol>
